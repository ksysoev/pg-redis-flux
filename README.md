# pg-redis-flux
This repository contains a script that performs Change Data Capture (CDC) from PostgreSQL to Redis. The script efficiently captures and streams changes from a PostgreSQL database to a Redis instance, ensuring real-time data synchronization between the two systems. Ideal for applications requiring up-to-date data across different storage solutions.
